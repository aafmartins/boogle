## BOOGLE

## DESCRIPTION

This is an application where you can create your own personal bookshelf with books that you already read. The user has access to a lot of details about each book. With the implementation of the search bar, you will be able to look through a huge selection of books.

## USER STORIES

404 - As a user you want to see a nice #404 page in case the page doesn't exist.

Homepage - As a user you want to be able to sign-up, log-in & access your profile and search for books.

Sign up - As a user you want to sign up so you can see the details of your book search & add them to your book shelf.

Login - As a user you want to log in and access your profile & bookshelf.

Logout - As a user you want to be able to log out from the webpage so that you can make sure no one will access your account.

UserProfile - As a user you want to access your profile and edit/delete/update your bookshelf.

Book-search-results - As a user you want to be able to search for a book and access the details of those books and save them to your profile.
